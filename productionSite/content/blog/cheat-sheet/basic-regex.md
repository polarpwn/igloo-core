## What Is RegEx?
Regular Expressions, RegEx, is a powerful method of pattern matching in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly on processing text files. RegEx involves using a wide variety combination of characters, quantifiers, logics, and other built-in classes to form a specific curated strings that represent a pattern that can fetch kinds of strings. For example, we may have list of a ```.CSV``` file that contains thousands of email addresses. If you wanted to set such rules to verify either each entry have the proper and valid format or not, instead of doing it manually, you can simply match it againts a specific pattern to get the result of its validation in terms of true or false, then even chaining it to other utilities to perform a further and advance action, either from the application or the system level. 

## RegEx Symbols and Patterns
### A. Characters
| Character   | Legend   
| --------  | -------- 
| \w | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, officia excepteur ex fugiat reprehenderit enim labore culpa sint ad. Nostrud officia pariatur ut officia. 
| \w | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, officia excepteur ex fugiat reprehenderit enim labore culpa sint ad. Nostrud officia pariatur ut officia. 
| \w | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, officia excepteur ex fugiat reprehenderit enim labore culpa sint ad. Nostrud officia pariatur ut officia. 

### B. Quantifiers
### C. Logics
### D. White Spaces
### E. Character Classes
### F. Anchors & Boundaries
### G. POSIX Classes
### H. Lookarounds
