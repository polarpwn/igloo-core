## Our Narrative
*polarpwn* (Platform for Offensive Learnings, Analysis, and Research), represents a cutting-edge community dedicated to cybersecurity, specifically focusing on the offensive aspect. As a Platform for Offensive Learning, Analysis, and Research, *polarpwn.gg* creates an environment that fosters continuous learning and skill development in the field of cybersecurity. The organization serves as a hub for individuals interested in offensive cybersecurity techniques, offering a dynamic platform for sharing insights, research papers, and write-ups. Through collaborative efforts, *polarpwn.gg* encourages the exploration of innovative projects that contribute to the collective knowledge of the community, making it a vibrant space for professionals and enthusiasts alike to engage in the evolving landscape of offensive cybersecurity.

Writing is one of your best mediums to learn or share something with others. Inspired by Hak5, we also intend to develop our in-house tools and payloads relevant to the security industry. By building such a community-driven platform, we hope all of the contents within this platform can be of good use for others to benefit from.

### Vision
Our vision is to become one of the go-to platforms of choice for others to search similar cases or problems about infosec in general or even to try out and develop pentesting tools & payloads for our community-based arsenal.

### Mission
Our mission is to support the interest in publishing content for others to help the public awareness of information security in this digital world as a form of giving back to the community.
